    <p style="width:50%">Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of
    noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog
    lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline,
    presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can
    turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of
    canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to
    learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German
    Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness
    that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'¬ù</p>

    <p style="width:50% ">he Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and
    affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered
    breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a
    gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.
    
    The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He
    cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador
    Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to
    many parts of the world</p>

    <h3><li>Bulldog</li></h3>
    <img src="/pexels-creative-workshop-3978352.jpg" width="50%" alt="">
    <p style="width:50%">The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog.
    It is of medium size, a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose.[4] It is commonly
    kept as a companion dog; in 2013 it was in twelfth place on a list of the breeds most frequently registered
    worldwide.[5]
    
    The Bulldog has a longstanding association with British culture; the BBC wrote: "to many the Bulldog is a national icon,
    symbolising pluck and determination".[6] During the Second World War, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill was likened
    to a Bulldog for his defiance of Nazi Germany.[7] The Bulldog Club (In England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club
    of America was formed in 1890.</p>
